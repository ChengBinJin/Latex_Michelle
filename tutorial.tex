\section{Critical Thinking Questions (CTO's) (20 pts)}

Answer each question using complete sentences. You may choose to include sketches and/or examples to enhance your explanations. Your written answers must be typed. Sketches may be hand drawn. If you prefer not to build a complete \LaTeX \ document, I recommend using Microsoft Word's built-in equation editor or use a \LaTeX \ equation editor such as the one found at \texttt{http://www.sitmo.com/latex} as needed.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Describe a real-world situation that could be represented by the equation $a=b+3$. Include a definition for each variable.
\item Explain the difference between $-3^2$ and $(-3)^2$ in terms of order of operations.
\item Describe the relationships between natural, whole, integer, rational, irrational, and real numbers. Give one example and one non-example of each.
\item Is it always possible to find a number in between any two distinct numbers on the real number line? Explain.
\end{enumerate}
